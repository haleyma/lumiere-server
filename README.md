A string of LED's is connected to Arduino which is controlled by a Raspberry Pi that looks to the web to figure out what color those LEDs should which is then controlled by SMS or a web interface.  Got it?

*Right now these are just notes as I build it*

## Arduino

The following parts are involved, but surely these can be interchanged with your preferred parts.

* [5 meter length of RGB LED strip (the LPD8806 model)](http://www.adafruit.com/products/306)
* [4 pin JST SM plug](http://www.adafruit.com/products/578) used to connect the LED strip to the Arduino board and the power supply.
* [5V 10A power supply](http://www.adafruit.com/products/658) for the Arduino.
* [5V 10A power supply](http://www.adafruit.com/products/658) for the LED strip.
