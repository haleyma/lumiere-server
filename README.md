# Lumi√®re

SMS :arrow_right: web :arrow_right: LED = fun for everyone.

## The basics

A string of LED's is connected to a Raspberry Pi which looks to the web to figure out what color those LEDs should be.  The website has an interface and an SMS mechanism for changin the color.  Got it?

Running example at: [lumiere.meteor.com](http://lumiere.meteor.com)

Though these instructions are details the code written has not been abstracted to where configuration is outside the code, so deploying means changing values in code.

Inspiration taken from [textmas](https://github.com/emilyville/textmas).

## Running web application

The application is a [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) application.

1. Install Meteor: `curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh`
1. (for development) Install Meteorite: `npm install -g meteorite`
1. Run locally: `meteor`
1. Deploy to Meteor.com: `meteor deploy <YOUR_APP_NAME>.meteor.com`

### Set up SMS

These instructions are for using Twilio, but it would not be too hard to change things around for another SMS service.

1. Create an account at Twilio.
1. Obtain a [phone number](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers) or use an existing one if you already have one set up.
1. Under the settings for that phone number, set the Messaging POST value to `http://<YOUR_APP_NAME>.meteor.com/incoming`.
1. There is no real set up for the web application part, but the application displays the phone number so you may want to up date that.

## Raspberry Pi

### Hook up lights

I used a [5 meter length of RGB LED strip (the LPD8806 model)](http://www.adafruit.com/products/306) to do this project, but you could do other things if you wanted to change the code for the Raspberry Pi a bit.  Also note that my hardware skills are not very good, so how to hook things up could probably be improved.

In short, I used this diagram (from [adafruit](http://learn.adafruit.com/light-painting-with-raspberry-pi/hardware)) to hook up the lights to the Raspberry Pi and share the power between the two.

#### Details

The following parts are involved, but surely these can be interchanged with your preferred parts.

* [5 meter length of RGB LED strip (the LPD8806 model)](http://www.adafruit.com/products/306).  If you get 5 meters of these LEDs they come with the JST input and output connected, otherwise, you may have to solder wires to the end in order to connect to the Raspberry Pi.  Also, people have reported that the input and output may not be what you expect so double check which end you connect to.
    * It is very important that you read [this tutorial](http://learn.adafruit.com/digital-led-strip/wiring) to know the intricacies of this LED strip.
* [4 pin JST SM plug](http://www.adafruit.com/products/578) used to connect the LED strip to other wires.  If you have a LED strip with a JST end, this will make it easy to disconnect things.
* [5V 10A power supply](http://www.adafruit.com/products/658).  The above LED strip can only handle 5V so don't use more.
* [Female DC power adaptor](http://www.adafruit.com/products/368) used to connect the LED strip and Raspberry Pi to the power supply.  For those of us that don't know about these things that well, the `-` should be connected to ground and `+` to the 5V power.
* Some [prototyping wires](http://www.instructables.com/id/Protobloc-prototyping-wires/).
* [4 wire caps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist-on_wire_connector) to connect the JST strand wires to the prototype wires which are solid wires.
* [2 snap action wire blocks to split the power](http://www.adafruit.com/products/866).
* [Cobbler breakout](http://www.adafruit.com/products/914) this is used to connect the Raspberry Pi GPIO to the breadboard.  Note that the ribbon cable came connected but not in a way that was intuitive to me and I ended up breaking things, so double check that the breakout board is aligned correctly with the GPIO diagram.
* [Breadboard](http://www.adafruit.com/products/64).

There is a good example of you might hook up the light efficiently at [this tutorial](http://learn.adafruit.com/light-painting-with-raspberry-pi/hardware).

Here is an image of my near final configuration:

### Install software

This script needs to be run as a user that has root priviledges as it needs access to the GPIO pins.

1. Enable SPI.
    * `sudo raspi-config`
    * Go to `Advanced options` and `enable SPI`.
1. Install python dev tools.  [Reference](http://raspberry.io/wiki/how-to-get-python-on-your-raspberrypi/).
    1. `sudo apt-get install python-dev`
    1. `curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py`
    1. `sudo python distribute_setup.py`
    1. `curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py`
    1. `sudo python get-pip.py`
1. Get code: `git clone https://github.com/zzolo/lumiere.git && cd lumiere`
1. Install Python packages: `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run manually with `python raspberry-pi/lumiere.py`

### Deploy

This adds an [Upstart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstart) script so that the light script is run automatically on start up and restarts if something goes wrong.

1. Install Upstart: `sudo apt-get install upstart`
1. Link the Upstart script in to init: `sudo cp /home/pi/lumiere/raspberry-pi/lumiere.upstart /etc/init/lumiere.conf && sudo chmod +x /etc/init/lumiere.conf`
1. Restart the Pi: `sudo shutdown -r now`
    * It should start automatically, but you can control the process manually with: `sudo service lumiere start|restart|status|stop`

#### Auto turn off

If you want to turn off the Raspberry Pi at a specific time, add the following line to cron.  Note that this will not actually turn off the lights or stop power going to the Raspberry Pi, but simply shuts it down so that power can be disconnected.  I am using this with a outlet timer that turns off a bit after the cron shutdown runs.

1. This adds a line to the crontab to shutodwn at `2:45 AM`: `(sudo crontab -l ; echo "45 2 * * * shutdown -h now") | sudo crontab -`
    * If you don't have a crontab for root yet, then you will get a message like `no crontab for root` which is fine.
